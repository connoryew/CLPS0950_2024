% Rules of BlackJack
% 1. If either the dealer or the player obtains a series of cards that have
% a combined value > 21, they have "busted" and lost the round.
% 2. CARD VALUES:
    % Cards 2 - 10 have a value equal to their face value.
    % J, Q, K have a value of 10. An Ace can be worth either 1 or 11 based
    % off of which would bring the player closer to 21 without going over
% 3. If both player and dealer have not busted, whoever is closer to 21 w/o
% going over has won the round
% 4. Players can either hit (take another card), stand (keep their current
% cards), double down (double their initial bet), split (double their
% initial bet and turn their two cards into two "separate hands" that are
% each able to hit for additional cards)
