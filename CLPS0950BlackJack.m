% Rules of BlackJack
% 1. CARD VALUES:
    % Cards 2-10 have a value equal to their face value.
    % J, Q, K eachhave a value of 10. 
    % An Ace can be worth either 1 or 11 based off of which would bring
    % the player closer to 21 without going over
% 2. Each round begins with both the dealer and the player receiving two
% cards. The player knows the value of both of their own cards, but only
% knows the value of one of the dealer's cards.
% 3. If the player is dealt an Ace AND a Face Card (J,Q,or K), that is a
% BlackJack, and they automatically win the round as long as the dealer
% does not ALSO have a BlackJack
% 4. Players can either SURRENDER (fold their intial hand w/o getting any 
% additional cards), HIT (take another card), STAND (keep their current
% cards), DOUBLE DOWN (double their initial bet), or SPLIT (double their
% initial bet and split two equal cards into two "separate hands" that are
% each able to hit for additional cards)
% 5. Once the player has decided to STAND on all available hands, the 
% dealer reveals their hidden card
% 6. If either the dealer or the player obtains a series of cards that have
% a combined value > 21, they have "busted" and lost the round.
% 7. If both player and dealer have NOT busted, whoever is closer to 21 w/o
% going over has won the round
% 8. If the player and dealer have NOT busted AND they have cards that sum
% up to the same value, the result is a PUSH, where neither party wins the
% round.
